#MODULE 1 :Hello Hackers
**Introduction to all the modules are this module**
This module contained _two tasks:Commands and arguments_ and it was pretty simple to solve. 

****
**Intro to commands**
Here we had invoke a message in the terminal and using the echo function where in I had to type echo hi to get back a "_hello_" from the terminal.I solved this easily as I did clearly what was instructed.
****
**Intro to arguments**
This is very similar to the previous task but here we had to get a message "_Hello Hackers!_" without using the echo function.
This was easy to do and I got it in my first try as it was explained clearly.
